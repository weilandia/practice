[Example video](https://vimeo.com/149030350)

cp is a program that receives 2 filenames
and copies the first file into the second.

1. Make a file
2. Copy it to a second file using `cp`
3. Cat them both out
4. Make your own `cp` program
5. Copy it to a third file using `ruby cp.rb`
6. Cat all three out

Waypoints
=========

Waypoints are short practical demonstrations of a skill / topic.

So you think you're going to sit through a 3 hour class and come away with some skill?
During hours 2 and 3, you're just building on a shaky foundation.
I can't do that, hell I can't even read a blog and remember what the topic or takeaways were,
hell I can't even read (I'm dictating this to a stenographer).

Ability is the currency of comprehension, not notes.
So take notes to help you, but at the end of the day,
you need to perform something to solidify that knowledge.
That's what waypoints are for.

Setup
-----

You can do this however you like, but for simplicity, I'll define a structure you can follow unless you have some reason not to:

* Make a directory called `waypoints` in your `turing` directory: `$ mkdir ~/turing/waypoints`
* Go to that directory `cd ~/turing/waypoints`
* For each of the lessons below, you can make a directory to practice the waypoints in, eg for the "How testing works" lesson:

  ```sh
  $ cd ~/turing/waypoints
  $ mkdir how-testing-works
  $ cd how-testing-works
  ```

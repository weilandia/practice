# [How testing works](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/how_testing_works.markdown)

* [Material](https://github.com/JoshCheek/how-to-test)

## Waypoints

* Make the file `test/example_test.rb`
* In that file, make two classes, `PassingTest` and `NonPassingTest`
* Give `PassingTest` one test, which passes
* Give `NonPassingTest` class a failing test, an erroring test, and a skipped test that would fail if it weren't skipped.

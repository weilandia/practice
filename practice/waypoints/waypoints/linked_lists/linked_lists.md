# [Linked Lists](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/linked_lists.markdown)

[Example Video](https://vimeo.com/148098899)

Make a linked list with the data `"a",` `"b"`, `"c"`. Each node in the list is an array of length 2,
the first element being the data, the second being the link. Show that you can access each String.

Same thing, but with a hash table whose keys are `:data` and `:link`.

Same thing, but with an object that has methods `data` and `link`.
